A snippet of code I wrote as an exercise to figure out how Scala's
implicit conversions work.  It's a neat concept -- it lets you fake
subclassing types declared as final.  I just have a simple use-case
here, but it's easy to imagine more interesting ones: a safe SQL
string class is one; guaranteed prime integers is another.

To build and run:

$ scalac EmailAddress.scala ImplicitsTest.scala
$ scala ImplicitsTest
